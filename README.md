# 🔍 PDF RAG — Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Scratch

A self-directed deep dive into **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — built to understand how modern AI pipelines work under the hood, from raw text ingestion all the way to semantic search.

> **Status:** 🚧 In Development — architecture planned, implementation in progress

## 💡 What This Project Does

Upload any PDF and ask it questions in plain English. Rather than keyword matching, the system understands *meaning* — surfacing the most relevant passages using vector similarity search.

```
PDF → Parse → Chunk → Embed → Store in Vector DB → Query → Answer
```

This is the same fundamental pipeline behind tools like ChatGPT's file uploads, Notion AI, and enterprise document search systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| PDF Parsing | `PyMuPDF` / `pdfplumber` | Robust text + layout extraction |
| Embeddings | `sentence-transformers` | Pretrained SBERT models, no fine-tuning needed |
| Vector Database | `ChromaDB` | Lightweight, local-first vector store |
| Language | Python 3.10+ | Industry standard for ML pipelines |

## 📐 Key Concepts Explored

- **Text Embeddings** — converting unstructured text into dense numerical vectors that encode semantic meaning
- **Chunking Strategy** — splitting documents into overlapping segments to preserve context across chunk boundaries
- **Cosine Similarity** — measuring vector proximity to rank retrieved passages by relevance
- **RAG Pipeline Design** — decoupling retrieval from generation; understanding where each component lives in the stack
- **Vector Databases** — indexing, storing, and querying high-dimensional embeddings efficiently

## 🎯 Why I Built This

RAG is one of the most widely deployed patterns in production AI systems today. Rather than treating it as a black box, I wanted to learn it myself. From how embeddings encode meaning, to how vector databases work.
